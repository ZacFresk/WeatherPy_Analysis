# WeatherPy_Analysis

## Objective

Jack wants us to update the PlanMyTrip app. The original setup was loved by Beta testers and have asked for a few updates. Using APIs from OpenWeather and Google Maps. We will determine Weather Descriptions, Creating a Personal Travel Itinery, and Travel Route Informaiton between Several Cities.

 The following information was created from APIs from OpenWeather and Google Maps we were able to produce the requested updates to the PlanMyTripApp including:
- Criteria input where the customer can enter what their desired tempurature would be, bu selecting the max and min.
- Heat map to show where these cities are throughout the work, and showing them on the map with the closest lodging to that city.
- Producing an option for the client to create an itinerary based on where they want to go on their trip and producing the closest hotel to their destination.
